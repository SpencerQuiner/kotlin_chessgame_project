# Overview

The purpose of this project was to familiarize my self with the Kotlin programming language. I have not used Kotlin or Java before so I am unfamiliar
with the syntax of the programming language. 

I wrote a simple chess game that runs in the console. 

The purpose of writing this project is to learn to write in the Kotlin programming language.
